# Inline-Game
Practice project to run an inline game that is hangman. I've created this project for practice purposes in order to continue to learn python. 


## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the command `python hangman.py` to start the game.

## Usage

1. The game will prompt you to guess letters to find the hidden word.
2. Enter a single letter as your guess and press Enter.
3. You have 6 attempts to guess the word correctly.
4. The game will display the partially guessed word and the letters you have already guessed.
5. If your guess is correct, the letter will be revealed in the word. Otherwise, you will lose an attempt.
6. Keep guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.
7. After the game ends, you will be notified if you won or lost, and the correct word will be displayed.

## Features

- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list of words.
- Displays the partially guessed word with underscores and reveals correct guesses.
- Tracks the guessed letters and remaining attempts.
- Provides feedback on incorrect guesses and the game outcome.
